      Background information Jaworzno is the 13th-largest city in Poland in terms of area, with almost 100,000 
      population located in the south of Poland near Krakow and Katowice. The proximity of two airports and good 
      road infrastructure means that commuting and arriving for all participants will be an easy matter.
      A beautiful renovated town square and a church with one of the largest stained glass windows in Europe and 
      are just a few reasons to visit this city! 
    </p>
      <p>
      The festival City Days is a free event that provides the local public as well as tourists from everywhere 
      in Poland and Europe with unlimited access to culture and entertainment, offering large-scale open air concerts,
      fun sports events for children and adolescents and a great variety of food trucks. The festival is organized annually
      to integrate the community, but also to remind about the history of a given region and cultivate traditions.
      Many attractions and games have been prepared, so participants cannot complain of boredom. Some of the city's stunning
      landmarks are Gródek Park, a unique place on the map of Poland. It delights with views and is not without exaggeration 
      called by locals "Croatia" or "paradise island." and *GEOsfera, a theme park with gardens is a place open to visitors 
      who are interested in history and excavation. This ecological and geological object is located in a former quarry. 
    </p>
    <p>
       Walking around the area, you can come across life-size paleo-reconstructions of vertebrates unearthed there,
       information boards and exhibitions, presenting and bringing closer the history, and more specifically the Triassic period.
