      finals at the city festival, played side by side with a freestyle,
      mini-net and workshop area for the public to try out and meet the players

      show the footbag community some of the most beautiful landmarks of the
      Jaworzno region with footbag golf and chill&grill for all participants.

      (6 footbag net courts plus additional freestyle area) and a shopping mall
      (for Freestyle events only).

      Detailed information for players about schedule, accommodation, airport

      April) will be published and regularly updated at the event’s domain:

      more than a tournament, shred and spike hard, hang out, celebrate our
      beloved sport and its community and spread the passion!
    </p>

    <p>
      Background information Jaworzno is the 13th-largest city in Poland in
      terms of area, with almost 100,000 population located in the south of
      Poland near Krakow and Katowice. The proximity of two airports and good
      road infrastructure means that commuting and arriving for all participants
      will be an easy matter. A beautiful renovated town square and a church
      with one of the largest stained glass windows in Europe and are just a few
      reasons to visit this city!
    </p>
    <p>
      The festival City Days is a free event that provides the local public as
      well as tourists from everywhere in Poland and Europe with unlimited
      access to culture and entertainment, offering large-scale open air
      concerts, fun sports events for children and adolescents and a great
      variety of food trucks. The festival is organized annually to integrate
      the community, but also to remind about the history of a given region and
      cultivate traditions. Many attractions and games have been prepared, so
      participants cannot complain of boredom. Some of the city's stunning
      landmarks are Gródek Park, a unique place on the map of Poland. It
      delights with views and is not without exaggeration called by locals
      "Croatia" or "paradise island." and *GEOsfera, a theme park with gardens
      is a place open to visitors who are interested in history and excavation.
      This ecological and geological object is located in a former quarry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking around the area, you can come across life-size
      paleo-reconstructions of vertebrates unearthed there, information boards
      and exhibitions, presenting and bringing closer the history, and more
      specifically the Triassic period.
